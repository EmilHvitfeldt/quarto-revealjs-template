<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of quarto-revealjs-template is to act as my personal starter template for slides. It sets the infrasturcture I end up using quite a lot.

- Adds a working empty `styles.scss` file and links it in the yaml
- Adds a empty script div `all-the-js-code.html` file and includes it for use with [Revealjs events](https://revealjs.com/events/)
- Changes aspect ratio to 16/9
- Changes default of `code-line-numbers` to `false`

## Installation
